        If this were a real website with more than one and a half pages it would
        probably have enough content to put in this footer, but alas, that is
        not the case.

        Honestly, this footer is here just because the bottom of the page looks
        weird without it, but also, I didn't want to do what Wikipedia does in
        their footer (stuff about terms of use and licensing) so here we are.
